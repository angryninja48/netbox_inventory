# Netbox Inventory (WIP)

Uses the python requests module to hit the netbox api and build out a dynamic inventory

## Motivation

There are plenty of netbox inventory scripts out there however none that I have come across pull hostvars for each device as well. This dynamic script will query the netbox api and assign hostvars to each host.

## Requirements

* Requirements.txt
* Python3
